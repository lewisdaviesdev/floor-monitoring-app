## Project Details
* Please extract and save project to local storage/git clone before use
* Open index.html to begin
* Bottom table will show any live floods
* Search has ability to limit top table by county
* No prerequisites/dependencies, wanted to keep it simple
* Well commented and structed code
* Used one of my favourite bootstrap themes, I think it show cases the app well and has tonnes of scalability
* Dev tools on Chrome was the only testing tools used, since it was a small project, also used fiddler/postman to test api calls
* You can access the logged api responses through the browser dev tools, by typing 'localStorage' in console. Usually I would log error responses within a cloud repo/network storage for bigger projects, for the reason of re-running those requests within fiddler/postman to debug
